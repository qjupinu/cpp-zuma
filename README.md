# cpp-zuma
A simplified C++ Zuma remake

## Rules and objectives:
- The player will shoot (Left-click) colored balls towards the chain of balls that will continuously push forward.
- When three or more balls of the same color come in contact, they 'explode', possibly triggering other explosions as part of a chain reaction. 
- The player carries two balls at a time and can switch between them (Right-click).
- The player has 60 seconds to score as many points as possible before the balls reach the end.
